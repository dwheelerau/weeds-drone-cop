## Advantages of using remote sensing for weed control  

Remote sensing platforms offer many advantages over traditional methods for detecting weeds:  
- digitalisation of the process facilitates the incorporation of AI assisted technologies (categorisation, segmentation)  


## Disadvantages of using remote sensing for weed control  

Key core disadvantages of using remote sensing for weed control:  
- low image resolution  
- short flight time of drone plantforms  
- model error  
- blaa 


## Camera technologies  

### General considerations  

### RGB  

### Multispectral  

### Hyperspectral  

### Infra-red
