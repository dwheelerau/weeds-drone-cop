## What is remote weed detection?
Bla bla...  

## Aims and applications of remote detection  

## Knowing your species and landscape
- Weed phenology and temporal changes 
- Look-alike species and phenology and temporal changes 
- Terrain features 
- Selecting a mapping site 
- Terrain access 
- Internet access for georeferencing 

## Data capture platforms 
Ideas: Using project case studies to highlight aspects of each section – invite others to add their case studies to each section – include a template to fill out on their work, with links to contacts/data. Could also be set up this way in the analysis section - Ability to cross reference weed and sensor in search- case studies include a number of weeds investigated that are listed under each sensor, but can be searched via weed or sensor.

### Know your aerial platform

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) 
- Features 
- Considerations 

Fixed wing/helicopter  
- Features 
- Considerations 

Satellite 
- Features 
- Considerations 
- Access  

## Mission planning  
Links to broad information, and including some more specifics associated with weeds. Could include the GeoNADIR pdf (with permission) on the website 
- Equipment, safety and flight regulations/restrictions 
- Planning software 
- Selecting altitudes/ pixel size 
- Weather, light and terrain  
- Flight path and map 
- Batteries, SD cards 
- Recording flight data 

## Ground truthing protocols  
- What is ground truthing and when is it undertaken? 
- What are ground control points and why are they important? 
- Alignment of imagery 
- Vegetation data 
- Weather and landscape data 
- Georeference data 
- What is ground truthing and when is it undertaken? 
- What are ground control points and why are they important? 
- Alignment of imagery 
- Vegetation data 
- Weather and landscape data 
- Georeference data 


## Tips for using drones effectively  
### safety  
### image overlap and flight path design 
### altitude
### camera angle
### time of day and weather considerations
### etc  


## Sensors  

### General considerations  
- limitations

### RGB  
- Features 
- Considerations 
- Flight paths 
- Sensor settings 
- Data file management 

### Multispectral  
- Features 
- Considerations 
- Flight paths 
- Sensor settings 
- Data file management 

### Hyperspectral  
- Features 
- Considerations 
- Flight paths 
- Sensor settings 
- Data file management 


## Data processing
Ideas: Consideration of weed species with most suitable processing for each sensor – selection of models etc etc – here is what we did with each weed – contact details for those who have worked with the method they are interested in. 

Use an infographic to show the processing path for each sensor – Narmilan and Felipe developing pathway diagram for each sensor. This will be used in guidelines. Could be clickable, to click on each section and where to find more information. Connect to COP to get more information and connect to those working in this space for support. 

Perhaps could then have classifieds section in COP for those who need help with processing – e.g. “I need help with x, y, z” and a CoP member provider could answer. – set up with Gulbali centre. 

Create case study with HW to share as a template – may help to refine the infographic with steps. 

Could have different sections targeting different levels of complexity – different section about processing for landholder to what we say to someone already working in processing. 

### Outputs  
- what format?
- shareable
- standardised
- measurement of error
- data storage and backup
- video or RGB images
- flight logs
- weather

### Artificial Intelligence algorithms
- automation
- common algorithms
- metadata and training datasets
- unsupervised learning
- limitations
- measurement of error
- no code and low code cloud platforms for AI (warnings)

## Disadvantages of using remote sensing for weed control  

Key core disadvantages of using remote sensing for weed control:  
- low image resolution  
- short flight time of drone plantforms  
- model error  
- blaa
